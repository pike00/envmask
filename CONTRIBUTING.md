## Security Considerations

envmask is designed to prevent secrets from appearing in LLM conversation transcripts. When contributing:

- Do **not** weaken the masking strategy without discussion
- Consider the threat model (see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md))
- Test with real secrets (in a sandbox environment)
- Document any security implications in the PR

## Issues

- Bug reports: Please include `.env` file format/example (without real secrets)
- Feature requests: Describe the use case and expected behavior
- Check [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) to see planned features before requesting new ones

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and inclusive. We're all here to make security better.
